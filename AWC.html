    <h1>About Animals</h1>
    <p>Animals are integral to Earth's ecosystems, playing vital roles in maintaining balance and biodiversity. From the smallest insects to the largest whales, the animal kingdom showcases incredible diversity and adaptation. Humans have a complex relationship with animals, relying on them for food, companionship, and labor while also recognizing their intrinsic value and advocating for their rights. Let's know more.</p>
    <h2>Mammals</h2>
    <p>Mammals are a class of vertebrate animals characterized by having hair or fur, mammary glands that produce milk for their young, and three middle ear bones. They are also warm-blooded and typically give birth to live young, although a few species lay eggs. Mammals are incredibly diverse, inhabiting a wide range of environments from the coldest polar regions to the hottest deserts.</p>
    <h2>Reptiles</h2>
    <p>Reptiles are a diverse group of vertebrate animals characterized by having dry, scaly skin and typically laying hard-shelled eggs. They are cold-blooded, meaning their body temperature is regulated by their environment, and they breathe air using lungs. Common examples include snakes, lizards, turtles, and crocodiles.</p>
    <h2>Aerial</h2>
    <p>Aerial animals are animals that can fly or glide through the air. They are characterized by adaptations like wings, feathers, and lightweight bodies that allow them to navigate the skies. Birds and insects are the most common examples, but some mammals like bats and even certain reptiles like flying squirrels also exhibit aerial locomotion.</p>
    <h2>Amphibians</h2>
    <p>Amphibians are a class of cold-blooded vertebrate animals, known for their ability to live both in water and on land. They are characterized by their moist skin, which they use to breathe, and their ability to undergo metamorphosis, transforming from aquatic larvae to terrestrial adults.
